**See how the news is shaped - not just what’s reported.**

News Constellation is an AI-powered **media literacy tool** that visualizes how news stories relate to one another. Instead of consuming headlines in a linear feed, users explore a **3D semantic map of the news**, revealing topic clusters, coverage patterns, and under-reported stories.

---

## 🚀 Inspiration

Most people consume news as endless lists and timelines. This format strips away context, hides bias, and makes it difficult to understand how different outlets frame — or ignore — the same events.

News Constellation was built to **combat misinformation and propaganda by restoring context**, helping users think critically about what they read.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Ingest live news articles** based on a user’s query
2. **Scrape full article text** from each source
3. **Convert articles into semantic embeddings** using a transformer model
4. **Build a similarity graph** where articles are connected by meaning
5. **Automatically cluster stories** into topics using graph community detection
6. **Visualize the result as an interactive 3D galaxy**

Each cluster represents a topic, and each node represents an article — making coverage patterns immediately visible.
